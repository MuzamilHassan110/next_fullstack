Zod is full fill the gap of runtime while typescript have the compile 
time here

in modlas we use the doucment which is for type safty purpose


how to export the models in next js 
here we can be use the two way in next js

const UserModels = (mongoos.modles.User as mongoose.Model<User>)
 ||(mongoose.model<User>("User", UserSchema))

next js is the edge time framwork (application not execute continously
while execute when the user request is coming all the function is run
on time. all time not application is not running so db connection is also
so check the db connection if the db is connect then use otherwise 
create the connection of the db);


Auth
two files options and route => then go to the provider of the auth docs
provider
pages, callbacks

if we use the next-auth with typescript then create the some time
issue here then we slove it by change the types of module 
and make the separete file here which is next-auth.d.ts

declare module 'next-auth' {

}

In this project we made the check-user-uniqe name for this 
when user is type then gave the suggestion user is exsist or not

const {searchParams} = new URL(request.url);
const queryParam = {
 username: searchParam.get("username")
}
